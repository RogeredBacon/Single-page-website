		Roger Bacon was an English philosopher and Franciscan friar regarded as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method inspired by Aristotle.
		In his time he was thought to be a wizard and is famous for the story of his mechanical/necromantic brazon head.
		<br><br>He contributed much to the schools of optics, mathamatics, alchemy, geography, mechanics, astronomy and is often credited with being the first European to mention the chemical mixture that would later come to be known as gunpowder.
		In his book <i>Opus Tertium</i> he writes about a chinese firecracker his friend had aquired whilst visiting the Mongol Empire:
		<br><br><i>
			We have an example of these things (that act on the senses) in [the sound and fire of] that children's toy which is
			made in many [diverse] parts of the world; i.e. a device no bigger than one's thumb. From the violence of that salt
			called saltpetre [together with sulphur and willow charcoal, combined into a powder] so horrible a sound is made by
			the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment [containing it], that we find [the ear assaulted
			by a noise] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning.
		</i><br><br>During the late medieval period when he lived he was largely ignored by his contemporaries in favor of other scholars such as Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas.</p>

				However by the early modern period he was regarded by the English as the epitome of a wise and subtle possessor of forbidden knowledge,
				a Faust-like magician who had tricked the devil and so was able to go to heaven.<br>Of these legends, one of the most prominent was that he created a talking brazen head which could answer any question. 
				The story appears in the anonymous 16th-century account of <i>The Famous Historie of Fryer Bacon</i>, in which Bacon speaks with a demon but causes the head to speak by "the continuall fume of the six hottest Simples",
				testing his theory that speech is caused by "an effusion of vapors".<br><br>Around 1589, Robert Greene adapted the story for the stage as <i>The Honorable Historie of Frier Bacon and Frier Bongay</i>, one of the most successful Elizabethan comedies.
				As late as the 1640s, Thomas Browne was still complaining that "Every ear is filled with the story of Frier Bacon, that made a brazen head to speak these words, <b>Time is</b>".<br><br>
				The legend states that after toiling for days on his greatest creation Bacon falls asleep, and the moment he closes his eyes, the brazen head speaks three times, saying "<b><i>Time is,</i></b>" "<b><i>Time was,</i></b>" and "<b><i>Time is past</i></b>" â€” then falls to the floor and shatters.<br>
				 Miles Bacons foolish apprentice doesn't have the wit to wake his master in time.
